        <h1>Dungeons & Dragons Character Creation Guide</h1>
        
        <h2>Chapter 1: Race Selection</h2>
        <p>Choosing your character's race is the first major decision in D&D character creation. Each race provides specific ability score increases, traits, and cultural background that shape your character's identity and capabilities.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Human:</strong> Versatile and adaptable, humans receive a +1 to all ability scores. They are excellent for any class and provide flexibility in character builds.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Elf:</strong> Graceful and long-lived, elves receive a +2 to Dexterity. They have keen senses, fey ancestry, and proficiency with certain weapons.</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 2: Class Features</h2>
        <p>Your character class determines your core abilities, hit points, proficiencies, and how you contribute to your adventuring party.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Fighter:</strong> Masters of martial combat, fighters can use all armor and weapons. They gain Second Wind for self-healing and Action Surge for additional actions.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Wizard:</strong> Scholars of arcane magic, wizards cast spells using their Intelligence. They prepare spells from a spellbook and can learn new spells as they advance.</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 3: Ability Scores</h2>
        <p>Six ability scores define your character's basic capabilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.</p>
        
        <p>Roll 4d6, drop the lowest die, and record the total. Repeat this process six times to generate your ability scores, then assign them to the six abilities as desired.</p>
