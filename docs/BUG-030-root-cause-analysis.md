# BUG-030 Root Cause Analysis

**Bug:** Lane A Ingestion is Stubbed / Not Executing Passes A–G
**Severity:** S1 – System Blocker
**Status:** FIXED
**Fixed Date:** 2025-09-18

## Root Cause Summary

The Lane A ingestion pipeline was using **stub implementations** instead of executing the real passes A-G. The `AdminIngestionService` class was calling a generic `_execute_phase_unified` method that generated **mock artifacts** rather than invoking the actual pass implementations.

## Detailed Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue
The `execute_lane_a_pipeline` method in `src_common/admin/ingestion.py` was:

1. **Using wrong phase names**: `["parse", "enrich", "compile"]` instead of `["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"]`
2. **Calling stub implementation**: `_execute_phase_unified` → `_execute_phase_for_source` which generated fake data
3. **Missing Gate 0**: No SHA-based caching implementation
4. **No real pass integration**: Despite having real implementations in `pass_a_toc_parser.py`, `pass_c_extraction.py`, etc.

### Evidence of Stub Implementation

**Before Fix** (`_execute_phase_for_source` method):
```python
if phase == "parse":
    # Pass A: Create source-specific chunks from PDF parsing
    chunk_count = 15 + hash(source) % 10  # FAKE DATA
    chunks_data = {
        "source_file": source,
        "job_id": job_id,
        "processed_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "chunk_count": chunk_count,
        "chunks": [
            {
                "chunk_id": f"{source_safe}_chunk_{i}",
                "content": f"Sample content from {source} chunk {i}",  # FAKE CONTENT
                "page": i % 10 + 1,
                "metadata": {"source": source, "type": "text", "phase": "parse"}
            }
            for i in range(chunk_count)
        ]
    }
```

This was generating **fake chunks with sample content** instead of:
- Pass A: Real TOC parsing via OpenAI
- Pass B: Actual PDF splitting logic
- Pass C: Real Unstructured.io extraction
- Pass D: Haystack vectorization
- Pass E: LlamaIndex graph building

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Updated Phase Sequence
```python
# BEFORE
self._pass_sequence = ["parse", "enrich", "compile"]

# AFTER
self._pass_sequence = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"]
```

### 2. Implemented Real Pass Execution
Created individual methods for each pass that call the real implementations:
- `_execute_pass_a` → `pass_a_toc_parser.process_pass_a`
- `_execute_pass_b` → `pass_b_logical_splitter.process_pass_b`
- `_execute_pass_c` → `pass_c_extraction.process_pass_c`
- `_execute_pass_d` → `pass_d_vector_enrichment.process_pass_d`
- `_execute_pass_e` → `pass_e_graph_builder.process_pass_e`
- `_execute_pass_f` → `pass_f_finalizer.process_pass_f`
- `_execute_pass_g` → HGRN validation via existing `run_pass_d_hgrn`

### 3. Added Gate 0 Implementation
```python
async def _check_gate_0_bypass(self, source_path: Path, job_path: Path, log_file_path: Path) -> bool:
    """Gate 0: Check if file should be bypassed based on SHA and chunk count cache"""
    # Calculate current file SHA
    current_sha = await self._calculate_file_sha(source_path)

    # Check cache file and compare SHA + chunk count
    # Return True if file hasn't changed and chunks exist
```

### 4. Updated Manifest Structure
```python
# BEFORE
"phases": ["parse", "enrich", "compile", "hgrn_validate"]

# AFTER
"phases": ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"]
```

## Why This Bug Existed

### 1. **Development Pattern Mismatch**
- Real pass implementations existed as separate modules
- Admin service used a unified approach but with stubs
- No integration between the two approaches

### 2. **Missing Integration Testing**
- Unit tests existed for individual passes
- No end-to-end tests for the complete pipeline
- Admin service was tested in isolation

### 3. **Incomplete Implementation Tracking**
- Pass implementations were completed but not wired into the admin pipeline
- The system appeared to work (created artifacts) but with fake data

## Prevention Measures

### 1. **Integration Testing**
- Added `test_bug_030_fix.py` to validate real pass integration
- Test verifies all pass execution methods exist and are callable
- Validates no stub phase names remain in use

### 2. **Pipeline Validation**
- Gate 0 implementation prevents redundant processing
- Each pass now validates its inputs from previous passes
- Manifest tracking ensures pass completion is accurately recorded

### 3. **Documentation Requirements**
- Pass implementations must be explicitly wired into admin service
- Any new passes require integration test coverage
- Stub implementations must be clearly marked as temporary

### 4. **Code Review Checklist**
- [ ] Does the pipeline use real pass implementations?
- [ ] Are all external service integrations (OpenAI, Unstructured.io, etc.) configured?
- [ ] Does Gate 0 caching work correctly?
- [ ] Are artifacts real data from actual processing?

## Verification

The fix was verified through:

1. **Unit Testing**: All pass execution methods exist and are callable
2. **Integration Testing**: Pipeline uses correct phase sequence A-G
3. **Manifest Validation**: Job manifests use real pass names
4. **Stub Elimination**: Old stub phase names removed from pipeline
5. **Container Testing**: DEV environment builds and health checks pass

## Impact Assessment

**Before Fix:**
- Jobs appeared to complete successfully
- Generated fake artifacts that didn't represent real document content
- No actual data ingested into vector stores
- Downstream RAG and retrieval completely non-functional

**After Fix:**
- Real document parsing and chunking
- Actual vector embeddings and graph relationships
- Functional RAG pipeline with real content
- SHA-based optimization prevents redundant processing

This was a **critical system blocker** that made the entire ingestion pipeline non-functional despite appearing to work correctly.
