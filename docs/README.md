3. **Intelligence** (Phase 2): Query classification, policy-driven retrieval, model routing
4. **Workflows** (Phase 3): Graph-aware planning, multi-step reasoning, HITL approvals
5. **Admin Tools** (Phase 4): System management, monitoring, operational interfaces
6. **User Experience** (Phase 5): Web UI, real-time features, LCARS design
7. **Quality Assurance** (Phase 6): Testing automation, feedback collection
8. **Requirements** (Phase 7): Structured feature management, documentation generation

##  Development Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Git
- OpenAI API key (optional for full functionality)
- Cassandra Docker service (required for DEV/CI vector store)
- AstraDB credentials (optional fallback/production parity)

###  Windows Setup (Required Dependencies)

**For Windows users** - TTRPG Center requires Poppler and Tesseract for PDF processing:

```powershell
# Automated setup (recommended)
.\scripts\setup_windows.ps1

# Verify dependencies
python scripts/bulk_ingest.py --verify-deps
```

**Troubleshooting**: If setup fails, see [Windows Setup Guide](setup/WINDOWS_SETUP.md) for manual installation and troubleshooting.

### Get Running in 5 Steps
```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url> && cd TTRPG_Center
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Initialize development environment  
./scripts/init-environments.sh dev

# 3. Configure (edit with your keys)
cp env/dev/config/.env.example env/dev/config/.env

# 4. Start development server
./scripts/run-local.sh dev

# 5. Verify system health
curl http://localhost:8000/healthz
```

### First Development Tasks
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
pytest tests/unit tests/functional

# Test document ingestion
python scripts/ingest.py --env dev --file tests/fixtures/sample.pdf

# Try a query
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/rag/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is a fireball spell in D&D?"}'

# Access admin interface  
open http://localhost:8000/admin
```

##  Key Concepts

### Environment Isolation
Each environment (dev/test/prod) maintains complete separation:
- **Independent ports**: 8000/8181/8282  
- **Isolated configurations**: Environment-specific .env files
- **Separate data**: Independent storage and logging
- **Security boundaries**: No cross-environment contamination

### Graph-Centric Reasoning  
Knowledge graphs drive intelligent behavior:
- **Schema**: Rules, Concepts, Procedures, Steps, Entities with relationships
- **Workflow Planning**: Graph traversal for task decomposition
- **Multi-Hop Reasoning**: Citation-backed traversal with re-grounding
- **Provenance**: Full audit trails from graph to final answers

### AI Model Orchestration
Dynamic model selection based on query characteristics:
- **Classification**: Intent/domain/complexity analysis (<150ms)
- **Policy-Driven**: YAML configuration for retrieval strategies  
- **Model Routing**: Cost/latency-aware selection (GPT-4o, Claude, local)
- **Self-Consistency**: Multi-sample generation for complex reasoning
