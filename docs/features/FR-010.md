# FR-010 — Ingestion Management Reliability Pass

## Summary
Perform a comprehensive review of the Ingestion Management section and fix any broken flows—especially the Browse button for selecting sources.

## Scope
- Audit all controls: source selection (browse), schedule, ad-hoc triggers, status table, cancel control, “eye” icon.
- Fix Browse: ensure it opens system file dialog and correctly populates the source(s) list.
- Validate server endpoints for start/cancel/status retrieval.

## User Stories
1. As an Operator, I can browse and select one or more sources to ingest, and they appear in the form.
2. As an Operator, I can submit an ad-hoc job and see it reflected in the jobs list with the correct status and PID.

## Acceptance Criteria / Test Conditions
- AC1: Browse opens a picker and populates the source(s) field.
- AC2: Submitting with missing/invalid sources shows errors; valid submissions start jobs.
- AC3: Jobs table refreshes and shows correct PID/status transitions.
