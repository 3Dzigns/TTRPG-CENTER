# FR-012 — Ingestion Health Status from AstraDB

## Summary
Health status must be sourced from AstraDB truth: show each source with its number of chunks currently stored.

## User Stories
1. As an Operator, I see a real-time list of sources and chunk counts pulled from AstraDB.
2. As an Operator, if AstraDB is down, I get a clear error and retry option.

## Acceptance Criteria / Test Conditions
- AC1: Counts match a direct AstraDB query.
- AC2: Update cadence (manual refresh or ≤60s poll).
- AC3: Error/empty states clear and actionable.
