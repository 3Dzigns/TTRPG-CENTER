# FR-008 — Dedicated Log Management Page & Dashboard Cleanup

## Summary
Remove the “Logs” button from the Dashboard and introduce a full Log Management page accessible from the left tool menu. Centralize viewing/searching/filtering/downloading of logs (ad-hoc and nightly ingestion). “Eye” icons elsewhere should deep-link into this page.

## Rationale
Logs are operational artifacts and should be managed in a single, predictable location. This simplifies the Dashboard and reduces user confusion.

## Scope
- Remove “Logs” button from the Dashboard.
- Add “Log Management” to the left tool menu.
- Implement a list/table of log files with:
  - Columns: Job ID, Job Type (Ad-hoc/Nightly), Status (Running/Completed/Failed), PID (if running), Start Time, End Time, Duration, File Size, Source(s), Link (“Open”).
  - Search by Job ID, source, date range; filter by type/status.
  - Open-in-viewer (inline) with stream/tail for running jobs.
  - Download button for completed logs.
- Ensure all “eye” icons across the app link to this page with the job preselected.

## User Stories
1. As an Operator, I can open the Log Management page from the left menu to see all ingestion logs in one place.
2. As an Operator, I can search/filter logs by date range, source, job type, and status to quickly find a specific run.
3. As an Operator, I can open a running job’s log and see it live-update (tail).
4. As an Operator, I can download completed logs for offline review.
5. As an Operator, clicking an “eye” icon elsewhere deep-links me to the corresponding log.

## Acceptance Criteria / Test Conditions
- AC1: “Logs” button removed from Dashboard; “Log Management” present in left tool menu.
- AC2: Table shows correct columns and data for recent runs (nightly/ad-hoc).
- AC3: Search/filter by Job ID and status/type/date works correctly.
- AC4: Running job log view updates within ≤3s intervals.
- AC5: “Eye” icon deep-links correctly into Log Management.
