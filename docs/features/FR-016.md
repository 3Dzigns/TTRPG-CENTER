# FR-016 — Testing Page

## Summary
Build a dedicated Testing page to define, run, and review automated tests.

## User Stories
1. As a QA Admin, I can run the ingestion smoke suite and see pass/fail and logs.
2. As a QA Admin, I can export results and file bugs with prefilled details.

## Acceptance Criteria / Test Conditions
- AC1: Test executions produce timestamped result records.
- AC2: Failures can open a “Create Bug” flow with context.
