# FR-011 — Dashboard Labeling & Nightly Log File Naming

## Summary
- Rename Dashboard “Ad-Hoc” button to clearly say “Ad-hoc” (not “nightly run”).  
- Rename nightly run log file base name to “nightly_ingestion”.

## User Stories
1. As an Operator, I see a clearly labeled Ad-hoc button on the Dashboard.  
2. As an Operator, nightly logs are named with consistent “nightly_ingestion” prefix.

## Acceptance Criteria / Test Conditions
- AC1: Button label reads “Ad-hoc”.
- AC2: Next nightly run produces logs named nightly_ingestion_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log.
