# FR-013 — Recent Ingestion Jobs (Top 3) & Status Semantics

## Summary
Show only the 3 most recent ingestion jobs. Standardize status meanings:  
- Pending = Scheduled (only ever one)  
- Running = Active (show PID)  
- Completed = Finished (success or failed)

## User Stories
1. As an Operator, I see only the 3 most recent jobs with clear statuses and PID for running.
2. As an Operator, I can click through to see details/logs.

## Acceptance Criteria / Test Conditions
- AC1: Exactly 3 entries shown when ≥3 exist; fewer if <3 exist.
- AC2: Status mapping enforced and displayed correctly.
