# FR-009 — Move “Artifacts” into Dictionary Management & Remove Button

## Summary
Remove the “Artifacts” button and surface artifacts inside Dictionary Management.

## Scope
- Remove “Artifacts” button from Dashboard/Navigation.
- In Dictionary Management, add an Artifacts tab/section:
  - Browse artifacts by source/book, dictionary entry, chunk/page.
  - Preview/download artifact files.
- Cross-links: From a dictionary entry, jump to its artifact(s), and vice versa.

## User Stories

2. As a Content Admin, I can download a source’s artifacts for verification.

## Acceptance Criteria / Test Conditions

- AC2: Artifacts filterable by Source/Entry/Chunk.
- AC3: Cross-linking works both directions.
