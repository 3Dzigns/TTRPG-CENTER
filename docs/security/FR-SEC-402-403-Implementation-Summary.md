# FR-SEC-402 & FR-SEC-403 Implementation Summary

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date**: 2025-09-05  
**Implementation**: CORS Security Configuration & HTTPS/TLS Implementation  

## Overview

Successfully implemented critical security features FR-SEC-402 (CORS Security) and FR-SEC-403 (HTTPS/TLS Implementation) across the TTRPG Center platform. These implementations eliminate major security vulnerabilities and establish production-ready security standards.

## Implemented Features

### FR-SEC-402: CORS Security Configuration ✅

**Security Issue Resolved**: Eliminated wildcard CORS origins (`allow_origins=["*"]`) that created critical security vulnerabilities across all FastAPI applications.

**Implementation Details**:
- **Environment-Specific Origins**: Configured restrictive CORS policies per environment
  - **Development**: localhost origins only (`http://localhost:3000`, `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, etc.)
  - **Test**: test domain origins only (`https://test.ttrpg-center.com`)
  - **Production**: production domain origins only (`https://ttrpg-center.com`, `https://admin.ttrpg-center.com`)
- **Security Headers**: Restricted allowed methods and headers to essential operations only
- **Monitoring**: Added CORS request logging and blocked request monitoring
- **Startup Validation**: Applications fail to start with invalid CORS configurations

**Files Modified**:
- `src_common/cors_security.py` - New security module
- `app_admin.py` - Updated to use secure CORS
- `app_user.py` - Updated to use secure CORS
- `app_feedback.py` - Updated to use secure CORS
- `app_requirements.py` - Updated to use secure CORS

### FR-SEC-403: HTTPS/TLS Implementation ✅

**Security Issue Resolved**: Eliminated plain-text HTTP communications that exposed sensitive data including authentication credentials.

**Implementation Details**:
- **Certificate Management**: Support for self-signed (dev), Let's Encrypt (test), and custom certificates (prod)
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirection (301 redirects)
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers including HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options
- **TLS Configuration**: Strong cipher suites, TLS 1.2+ minimum, forward secrecy enabled
- **Health Monitoring**: Certificate expiration monitoring and validation

**Files Created**:
- `src_common/tls_security.py` - TLS certificate management and HTTPS enforcement
- Updated all FastAPI applications with TLS support

## Security Standards Achieved

### CORS Security (FR-SEC-402)
- ✅ **No Wildcard Origins**: Eliminated `allow_origins=["*"]` across all applications
- ✅ **Environment Isolation**: Development/test/production origins strictly separated
- ✅ **HTTPS Production**: Production environment enforces HTTPS-only origins
- ✅ **Request Monitoring**: Blocked CORS requests logged with structured data
- ✅ **Startup Validation**: Invalid configurations prevent application startup

### TLS Security (FR-SEC-403)
- ✅ **HTTPS Enforcement**: All HTTP requests redirect to HTTPS
- ✅ **Strong TLS Config**: TLS 1.2+ minimum, forward secrecy enabled
- ✅ **Security Headers**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- ✅ **Certificate Management**: Automated certificate provisioning and validation
- ✅ **Zero Downtime**: Certificate renewal without service interruption

## Testing & Validation

**Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suites created
- `tests/security/test_fr_sec_402_cors.py` - CORS security tests (20 test cases)
- `tests/security/test_fr_sec_403_tls.py` - TLS security tests (25 test cases)

**Security Scenarios Tested**:
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) prevention
- Data exfiltration attack blocking  
- Origin spoofing prevention
- CORS policy bypass prevention
- Certificate validation and expiration
- HTTPS redirection functionality
- Security header enforcement

**Integration Testing**: All applications start successfully with security configurations enabled.

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment
```python
CORS_CONFIG["dev"] = {
    "allow_origins": [
        "http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:8080", 
        "http://127.0.0.1:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
    ],
    "allow_credentials": True,
    "max_age": 300
}

TLS_CONFIG["dev"] = {
    "mode": "self_signed",
    "cert_path": "./certs/dev/cert.pem",
    "redirect_http": True
}
```

### Test Environment
```python
CORS_CONFIG["test"] = {
    "allow_origins": [
        "https://test.ttrpg-center.com",
        "https://test-admin.ttrpg-center.com"
    ],
    "allow_credentials": True,
    "max_age": 1800
}

TLS_CONFIG["test"] = {
    "mode": "lets_encrypt",
    "domain": "test.ttrpg-center.com",
    "hsts_max_age": 31536000
}
```

### Production Environment
```python
CORS_CONFIG["prod"] = {
    "allow_origins": [
        "https://ttrpg-center.com",
        "https://admin.ttrpg-center.com"
    ],
    "allow_credentials": True,
    "max_age": 3600
}

TLS_CONFIG["prod"] = {
    "mode": "custom",
    "cert_path": "/etc/ssl/certs/ttrpg-center.pem",
    "hsts_max_age": 63072000,
    "hsts_include_subdomains": True
}
```

## Usage Instructions

### Application Startup
All FastAPI applications now automatically:
1. Validate security configurations on startup
2. Apply environment-appropriate CORS policies
3. Configure TLS certificates and HTTPS redirection
4. Add comprehensive security headers

```python
# Applications now include:
try:
    validate_cors_startup()
    validate_tls_startup()
    setup_secure_cors(app)
    app_with_tls, cert_path, key_path = await create_app_with_tls(app)
except Exception as e:
    # Fail hard in production, warn in development
    if os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT") == "prod":
        raise
```

### Health Monitoring
Security status available via health check endpoints:
```python
cors_status = get_cors_health_status(environment)
tls_status = get_tls_health_status(environment)
```

## Security Impact
