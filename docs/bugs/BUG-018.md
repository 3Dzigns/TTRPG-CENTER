# BUG-025: Fix EnrichmentStats init (missing required args)


## Summary
`EnrichmentStats.__init__()` currently called without required arguments `normalization_ratio` and `processing_time_ms`, causing a runtime exception.

## Impact
Pass B failures and aborted jobs on affected files.

## Fix
- Update call site to pass `normalization_ratio: float` and `processing_time_ms: int`.
- Provide defaults (e.g., 1.0 and measured duration) only in non-critical paths.

## Acceptance Criteria (User Stories)
**US-025A (Dev)**: As a developer, enrichment completes and stats are recorded in `manifest.json`.
**US-025B (Ops)**: As ops, I can view enrichment timing/ratios in the Admin dashboard.

## Test Cases
**Unit**
- Instantiate `EnrichmentStats` with valid defaults → no exception.
- Missing args → linter/test fails (explicit).

**Functional**
- Run Pass B on a small fixture → manifest shows `processing_time_ms` and `normalization_ratio`.
