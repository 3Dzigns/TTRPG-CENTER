# BUG-034 — File Upload Issues in Ingestion Console

**Reported By:** Admin User  
**Date:** 2025-09-19  
**Environment:** WebUI (Ingestion Console), DEV/TEST/PROD  

---

## Description
When interacting with the **Upload Management** section of the Ingestion Console:

1. **Drag & Drop Failure:**  
   Dragging and dropping PDF files into the upload area does not initiate an upload. Instead, the browser attempts to open the file in a new tab, breaking the ingestion workflow.

2. **Browse Button Non-Functional:**  
   The **“Browse”** (file selection) button does not respond when clicked. No file selector dialog opens, preventing users from manually choosing PDFs for upload.

---

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to **Admin UI → Ingestion Console → Upload Management**.  
2. Attempt to drag a PDF into the drop zone.  
   - **Observed:** File opens in a new browser tab.  
   - **Expected:** File should be uploaded into the ingestion system.  
3. Attempt to click the “Browse” button.  
   - **Observed:** No action occurs.  
   - **Expected:** File picker dialog should open to allow manual selection of PDF(s).

---

## Expected Behavior
- Dragging and dropping a PDF should upload the file into the ingestion pipeline without redirecting the browser.  
- Clicking the Browse button should reliably trigger the file selection dialog.

---

## Actual Behavior
- Files are intercepted by the browser and opened in a new tab.  
- Browse button is non-functional.

---

## Impact
- Prevents Admins from adding new PDFs via the WebUI.  
- Blocks ingestion of new materials unless performed via backend/manual uploads.  
- Violates Phase 1–4 requirements that depend on proper ingestion workflow.  
- Impacts downstream retrieval and graph workflows (Phases 2–3) that require ingested content.

---

## Logs / Screenshots
N/A — issue is reproducible in browser UI with no server log output.

---

## Severity
**High** — Blocks all ingestion of new sourcebooks through UI.

---

## Suggested Fix
- Ensure drag-and-drop handlers prevent default browser file opening behavior (`event.preventDefault()` and `event.stopPropagation()`).  
- Wire drag-and-drop to the backend upload API.  
- Fix Browse button binding to trigger file input click event.  
- Add regression tests to ensure both methods function across DEV/TEST/PROD environments.

## **Root Cause Analysis**

**Primary Issues Identified:**

1. **Missing Global Drag/Drop Prevention**
   - **Problem**: Browser intercepted file drag events before they reached the upload area
   - **Cause**: No document-level event prevention for drag/drop outside upload zone
   - **Result**: Files opened in new tabs instead of triggering upload handlers

2. **Incomplete Event Handling**
   - **Problem**: Upload area drag handlers missing `stopPropagation()`
   - **Cause**: Events bubbled up to browser default handlers
   - **Result**: Browser file opening behavior overrode custom upload logic

3. **Browse Button Event Timing**
   - **Problem**: Event listeners potentially attached before DOM elements ready
   - **Cause**: Race condition in DOM initialization
   - **Result**: Browse button clicks not properly handled

**Technical Root Cause:**
The upload functionality failed due to insufficient event prevention in the client-side JavaScript. Modern browsers aggressively handle file drag/drop events, requiring explicit prevention of default behaviors both globally and locally.

---

## **Solution Implementation**

**1. Global Drag/Drop Prevention**
```javascript
function setupGlobalDragDropPrevention() {
    // Prevent default drag behaviors on entire document
    document.addEventListener('dragover', function(event) {
        if (!uploadArea.contains(event.target)) {
            event.preventDefault();
            event.dataTransfer.dropEffect = 'none';
        }
    });

    document.addEventListener('drop', function(event) {
        if (!uploadArea.contains(event.target)) {
            event.preventDefault();
        }
    });
}
```

**2. Enhanced Event Handling**
```javascript
function dropHandler(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    event.stopPropagation(); // Added to prevent event bubbling
    // ... upload logic
}
```

**3. Improved Browse Button Setup**
```javascript
browseBtn.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    event.stopPropagation();
    // Robust file picker triggering with error handling
});
```

## **Prevention Measures**

**Development Standards:**
1. **Event Prevention Protocol**: All drag/drop implementations must include both `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`
2. **Global Event Management**: File-related interactions require document-level event prevention
3. **DOM Readiness Checks**: Event listeners must be attached after DOM is fully loaded

**Testing Requirements:**
1. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Upload functionality must be tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
2. **Functional Tests**: Automated tests for both drag/drop and browse button paths
3. **Regression Suite**: Upload functionality included in CI/CD validation

**Code Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Event handlers include proper prevention methods
- [ ] Global event management implemented for file operations
- [ ] Error handling present for file picker operations
- [ ] Console logging available for debugging

---

✅ **Definition of Done**
- Drag-and-drop correctly uploads files in all supported browsers.
- Browse button opens file picker reliably.
- Unit + Functional tests added to verify both upload paths.
- Regression suite validates upload functionality in CI/CD (Phase 6 gates).
