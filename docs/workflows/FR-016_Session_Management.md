# FR-016 Cross-Session Workflow Management

## Overview

This document establishes a comprehensive cross-session workflow management structure for the FR-016 LCARS UI implementation project. It provides frameworks for session persistence, progress tracking, task coordination, and knowledge transfer across multiple development sessions.

## üîÑ Session Management Framework

  implementation_session:
    focus: "Active development, component implementation, API development"
    duration: "4-8 hours"
    deliverables: ["Working code", "Unit tests", "Documentation updates"]

  integration_session:
    focus: "System integration, testing, performance validation"
    duration: "3-6 hours"

# ADR-001: LCARS Theme Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context

- Negative: Requires modern browser support, complex CSS organization

## Implementation
- CSS custom property system with LCARS color palette
- JavaScript ThemeController class for state management
- LocalStorage persistence across sessions

## Validation
- Theme switch performance: <200ms target
- Cross-browser compatibility: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+

### Session Recovery Procedures

```markdown
## Session Recovery Protocol

### Scenario 1: Incomplete Session Handoff
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Review last commit messages and branch state
   - Check TodoWrite records for incomplete tasks
   - Validate current environment state (dev/test/prod)

2. **Context Reconstruction**:
   - Run automated test suite to identify broken components
   - Check performance benchmarks for regression detection
   - Review recent ADRs and decision logs

3. **Continuation Strategy**:
   - Prioritize critical path items from incomplete work
   - Re-validate dependencies before proceeding
   - Implement additional documentation for future sessions

### Scenario 2: Technical Blocker Discovery
1. **Blocker Assessment**:
   - Categorize blocker (technical, resource, external dependency)
   - Estimate impact on project timeline
   - Identify alternative implementation approaches

2. **Escalation Process**:
   - Document blocker with context and attempted solutions
   - Identify required expertise or resources
   - Implement temporary workaround if possible

3. **Resolution Tracking**:
   - Create specific resolution tasks in workflow
   - Update risk register with new information
   - Adjust session planning for resolution integration
