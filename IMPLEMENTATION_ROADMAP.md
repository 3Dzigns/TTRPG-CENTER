3. **User Experience (15%):** UI theming, feedback systems

### Timeline Estimate:
- **Critical items:** 4-6 weeks with focused development
- **High priority:** 3-4 weeks parallel development  
- **Medium/Low priority:** 2-3 weeks polish phase

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks:
- **QIC Performance:** Meeting sub-150ms requirement with complex classification

## Conclusion

The TTRPG Center project demonstrates **exceptional engineering maturity** with comprehensive security, testing, and architectural foundation. The system is approximately **75% complete** toward full requirements, with most gaps in intelligent query processing rather than foundational systems.

**Recommendation:** Focus development effort on RAG query processing completion and production deployment readiness. The strong foundation enables rapid feature completion once core intelligence systems are operational.

**Next Sprint Focus:**
1. Query Intent Classification implementation
2. Hybrid retrieval policy engine
3. Environment deployment automation
4. Graph workflow orchestration

This roadmap provides clear priorities for completing the remaining 25% of functionality needed for full production readiness.
